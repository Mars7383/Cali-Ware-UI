<h1>Cali-Ware UI</h1>
<p>A remake of Calamari-M's user interface for Script-Ware M, made with <a href="https://reactdesktop.js.org">react-desktop</a> and <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">electron.js</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>❗ Script-Ware was discontinued in 2023</h2>
<p>This UI will not be useable at all. You can, however, get past the login screen by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the development mode login: username <code>!DevelopmentBypass</code>, any password</li>
  <li>Using the Calamari trial mode recreation login: username <code>trial</code>, password <code>trial</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, note that nothing will function. If you want any of the bundled scripts from Calamari: press the <code>?</code> button on the bottom-right of the <code>Executor</code> tab > <code>Open Resources Folder</code> > Browse to <code>Calamari Defaults</code></p>

  <summary><strong>Is this safe to use?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  This is simply an alternative UI for Script-Ware M and doesn't send your credentials anywhere besides https://script-ware.com/ and the .DYLIB file downloaded by SW-M. Cali-Ware uses the same code for authentication as SW-M.
